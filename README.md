IoT simulated system that aims to preserve the environment and the bird species of an indoor artificial rainforest, which consists of various species of plants and birds. This ecosystem will be equipped with various sensors, both to enable the customers to have an experience sim- ilar to reality and to enable workers to understand better the live condition of the rainforest.

This two entities must be connected by a Nodered Broker.
